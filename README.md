CA2_DevOps

For this project, I decided to make an app that could convert Euro to Yen and vice versa

Technologies used include Java, Azure etc

I dont know what local development setup entails

Features of the application include the ability to convert euro to yen and the ability to convert yen to euro and users the ability to input the amount they want for each conversion

Don't ask about CI Pipeline implementation please

I have a separate branch for main and development. I experiment with code using the development branch and if they pass the unit test I push them to the main.

I have no testing strategy

Dont know what troubleshooting guide is
